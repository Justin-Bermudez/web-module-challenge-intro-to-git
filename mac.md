## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? An open source Distributed Version Control System
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based git hosting service
3. Why do we create a branch? You can take advantage of branching when working on new features or bug fixes because it isolates your work from other team members. 
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git switch
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository. The git pull command first runs git fetch which downloads content from the specified remote repository. Then a git merge is executed to merge the remote content refs and heads into a new local merge commit.
7. What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? edit the conflicted file
